<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>
On Linux or OSX, you're best to install with your package manager.
</p>

<p>
On OSX, I recommend {{=A('Homebrew', _href='http://brew.sh')}}.
</p>

<p>
On Windows, follow the links below.
</p>


Install the following:
<ul>
  <li>{{=A('Python 2.7', _href='https://www.python.org/downloads/')}}</li>
  <li>{{=A('git', _href='http://git-scm.com/download/win')}}</li>
  <li>{{=A('cmake', _href='http://www.cmake.org/download/')}} or greater</li>
</ul>


<h4>Creating a Project</h4>

<p>
  Gaen can build and run stand alone. In most cases, however, it is
  preferrable to create a project based on Gaen, whereby you can have
  some project specific C++ as well as your project specific Compose
  scripts living side by side with the Gaen source code.
</p>

<p>
  Create a new project as follows. In this example, we'll create a project called 'foo'.

  <ol class="build_steps">

    <li>
      Make a new blank directory for your project, and cd into it.

      {{=PRE('''C:\\code> mkdir foo
C:\\code> cd foo
''')}}
    </li>

    <li>
      Clone the Gaen repository and run start_project.py.

      {{=PRE(r'C:\code\foo> git clone https://github.com/lachlanorr/gaen.git')}}
    </li>

    <li>
      You will be prompted to continue, press 'Y' to create the project.

      {{=PRE('''Starting new project 'foo' in current directory...
Continue? [Y/n] Y

Gaen project 'foo' created in current directory.
Run bootstrap.bat to generate Visual Studio solution.
''')}}

      The project name is inferred from the current working directory.
      When completed, several files will be placed within the foo
      directory.
    </li>

    <li>
      Run bootstrap.bat to compile initial compose scripts as well
      as run cmake and create the Visual Studio solution.

      {{=PRE(r'C:\code\foo> bootstrap.bat')}}
    </li>

    <li>
      Open the solution.

      {{=PRE(r'C:\code\foo> build\win64\foo.sln')}}
    </li>
  
  </ol>

  On Linux or OSX, these instructions are nearly identical, except you need
  to run bootstrap.sh. On OSX, you'll open the generated Xcode project. On
  Linux, you'll run make against the generated Makefile.
